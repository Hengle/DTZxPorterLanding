# Donate to support my tools
Creating the best game ripping and modding tools takes a lot of time. Any amount contributed helps me spend more time working on them.

- All contributions go directly back into games to make tools for.
- I do not take requests, or give early access for donations in addition:
  - It's not fair to people who can't afford to donate.
  - Only donate if you want to support my tools and future work!
  - Don't donate if it's going to break your bank, seriously, take care of yourself first!
- You'll get a role and special color in my Discord server for showing your support.
