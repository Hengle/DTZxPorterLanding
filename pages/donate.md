# Donate to support my tools
Creating the best game ripping and modding tools takes a lot of time. Any amount contributed helps me spend more time working on them.

## Donate via PayPal
<form action="https://www.paypal.com/donate" method="post" target="_top">
    <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="TC7ELU6FD9GSL" />
    <input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" title="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" alt="Donate with PayPal button" />
</form>

## Support my company
If you can't support with a donation, the next best thing would be supporting my startup Quebic: [Here](https://quebic.com/invest).
