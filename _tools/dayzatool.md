## Usage:
Using DayZATool just requires one of the following formats:
- anm (For extraction)
- xob (For extraction)
- seanim (For generate)

## Command Line:
- By default, It will show the usage.
  - `--command input scale`.
- To extract anm files to seanim files:
  - `--extract-anim file.anm`
- To extract xob files to semodel files:
  - `--extract-mdl file.xob`
- To create a new anm file from a seanim:
  - `--generate-anim file.seanim`

> **NOTE:** You may have to play with the scale of the animation

> **SCALE:** Default scale is 100. That means that extraction does *= 100 on translations and generate does /= 100. To change the scale, the third parameter accepts a float value. 1 meaning no scale change.
