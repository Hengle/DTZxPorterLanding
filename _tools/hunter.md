# Hunter - TD2, Avatar Asset Extractor
Extracts all assets the games "The Division 2" and "Avatar Frontiers of Pandora". This software was developed by [DTZxPorter](https://twitter.com/dtzxporter).

## 💾 Download and version info:

> **IMPORTANT:** This software comes with no warranty what so ever.

- Download (Windows x64): [Hunter (v1.50)](https://mega.nz/file/sY4XmbJJ#u2DAAIpvuMRIVSlCQDnEoChUpFEsK83_Fe2_f39QHvk).

## ⚙️ Usage:
Read the new game tools tutorial: [Game Tool Tutorial](https://dtzxporter.com/game-tools-tutorial).

> **IMPORTANT:** Both the tool and the game **require** the entirety of the rouge folder to be intact and must not be modified in any way.

## Ripping:
- The **.sdftoc** files contain various encoded assets that Hunter can export; and, as of now the currently supported assets are:
  - Textures as [Dds, Png, Tiff]
  - Models as [Cast, SEModel, OBJ, XNALara, SMD, CoD XModel, Maya, Kaydara FBX].
  - Raw Files as-is.

> **NOTE:** This tool only exports assets as-is, without attempting to link models to their materials, and materials to their images. The game uses complex scene graphs which would require too much effort to automate, however, most of a model's textures have similar names to each other. It's very easy to locate the textures for a model yourself.

## 📌 Versioning:
- 1.00 - Initial Release.
- 1.50 - New GUI. More model format support v9-17 and uv fixes. New image format support. Avatar Frontiers of Pandora game support.
